# Path Searching Visualiser

## Tools
React.js, Redux.js, Bootstrap

This project built to help visualize how various path searching algorithms try to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node in the graph

## Graph Algorithms used in this project:
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
 - Astar
 - Best First Search
 - Breadth First Search
